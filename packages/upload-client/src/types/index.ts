/**
 * Upload Client Types
 * 
 * Re-exports all API types for convenient importing.
 * This allows consumers to import types directly from the main package
 * without needing to know the internal file structure.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { 
 *   ResourceResponse, 
 *   CreateResourceRequest, 
 *   ListResourcesParams 
 * } from '@tutenet/upload-client';
 * ```
 */

export * from './api';
